## üöÄ About Me

I have extensive experience in designing, implementing, and managing large-scale backend applications (Python/Django, Celery, RabbitMQ) and highly secure, virtualized Linux infrastructure (Proxmox, Docker, Ansible, FreeIPA). [cite: 1] My core expertise includes:

* Architecting and developing resilient backend systems, particularly using Python and Django.
* Implementing comprehensive security hardening across networks, servers (Linux Debian), and applications.
* Building and managing virtualized environments (Proxmox, Docker) and leveraging automation tools like Ansible for configuration management and policy enforcement.
* Establishing robust Identity Management (e.g., FreeIPA) and secure, encrypted network file services (NFSv4 with Kerberos).
* Optimizing system performance and workflows, including significant experience with asynchronous task processing (Celery, RabbitMQ), and creating effective backup strategies and observability solutions (Loki, Promtail, Grafana).

I am passionate about tackling complex technical challenges, continuously enhancing system security, and driving innovation in backend and infrastructure solutions.
